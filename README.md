# rn-performance-clock

The goal of this project is to easily test the clock used in React Native's `performance.now()` method.

Each time the `performance.now()` button is pressed, a new timestamp is added to an array that is displayed in the UI.
The app also shows the diff between the last two timestamps.

How to use:
```
git clone https://github.com/opayen/rn-performance-clock.git
cd rn-performance-clock
npm install
npx react-native run-android
```
